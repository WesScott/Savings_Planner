# Savings_Planner [THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT FEATURE COMPLETE OR BUG-FREE]

<p>The purpose of this app is to read in your expenses and pay and give you some basic reporting and savings options for the month. It is not yet dynamic, and pretty strict at the inputs and formatting it wants at this point</p>

<p>TODO's:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Error Handling</li>
  <li>Formatting</li>
  <li>Add dynamic feature set</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
